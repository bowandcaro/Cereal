# Cereal
exploratory data analysis of cereal nutrition

#Findings
#Ratings
Sugar: I was shocked to see that ratings of the cereals decreased with amount of sugar. I thought I would see an opposite trend. However then my question is who rated the cereals? what is their demographic? Surely it had no kids or young adults. 

Fiber, protein, potassium increase with ratings. 

Calories, sugar, fat, vitamins and sodium decreases with ratings. 

#Brands
Nabisco had the highest ratings with American Home Food Products coming in second. 
Nabisco cereals include.... 100% Bran, Cream of Wheat (Quick), Shredded Wheat, Shredded Wheat 'n'Bran, Shredded Wheat spoon size, Strawberry Fruit Wheats

#Sugar
#lowest Sugar
Quacker Oatmeal has the least amount of sugar. It says -1 so not sure how this is possible. Could be an error. The next 4 cereals have zero sugar. 
                 Puffed Wheat       0
       Cream of Wheat (Quick)       0
               Shredded Wheat       0
    All-Bran with Extra Fiber       0

#highest Sugar
Cereals with the most sugar. Suprisingly Raisin Bran! You would think this would be a healthier option, but alas stay away from it because it has the same amount of sugar as Apple Jacks. 
                   Smacks      15
             Golden Crisp      15
        Total Raisin Bran      14
    Post Nat. Raisin Bran      14
              Apple Jacks      14
              
#Protein
#highest protein
Cheerios suprisingly have pretty high proteins. Obviously this dataset doesn't include all cereals or brands including Kashi which I know has high amount of protein in their cereals.
                Cheerios        6
               Special K        6
          Quaker Oatmeal        5
               100% Bran        4
                All-Bran        4
#Hot vs Cold Cereal
There are 74 cold cereals and 3 hot cereals. Below are the 3 hot cereals and their brand.
       Cream of Wheat (Quick)   N
                        Maypo   A
               Quaker Oatmeal   Q
              
The largest difference between nutrients of Cold vs Hot cereal is sodium. Hot cereal has way less sodium. 

The brands Kelloggs and Genreal Mills take up most of the shelves. Though they don't have the higher ratings ... interesting. I believe more survey's need to be done on the cereal ratings and if this trend continues with the healthier cereals and Nabisco and American Home Food Products have higher ratings then they should be put on the shelves!
